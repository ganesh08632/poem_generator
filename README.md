EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The internship report shall have a brief executive summary. The Poetry Teller project is 
an AI-powered poetry generation system developed using Streamlit and Hugging Face 
APIs. The goal of the project was to create an interactive application that generates 
customized poems based on user input. Key learning objectives achieved include: 
 
• Understanding NLP models for text generation. 
 
• Implementing pre-trained AI models using the Hugging Face Transformers 
library. 
 
• Developing an interactive web application with Streamlit. 
 
• Enhancing API integration and optimization. 
 
• Testing and improving model responses for creative and coherent poetry generation. 
 
The project successfully delivered an application where users can input themes, emotions, 
or keywords, and the AI generates poetry tailored to their preferences.


INTRODUCTION

During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on the development of a Customized 
Poetry Generator leveraging Generative AI models. This project involved fine-tuning large 
language models (LLMs) for generating stylistic poetry based on user input. The internship 
provided me with hands-on experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep 
Learning, and AI-based Text Generation, allowing me to bridge theoretical knowledge with 
practical implementations. The goal was to create an AI-powered poetry generation system 
capable of producing creative, meaningful, and well-structured poems. 
3.2 Activities and Responsibilities 
Working-Conditions 
The internship followed a structured work schedule, with daily tasks and weekly progress 
reviews. I collaborated with mentors and team members through virtual meetings to discuss 
model improvements and feature enhancements. The working environment encouraged learning, 
problem-solving, and iterative development to refine the poetry generation process. 
Tasks Performed 
1. Understanding Generative AI Models – Researched transformer-based models like 
GPT-2, GPT-3, and Mistral to analyze their suitability for generating coherent and 
stylistic poetry. 
2. Dataset Collection & Preprocessing – Curated and preprocessed large poetry datasets to 
fine-tune the AI model for enhanced contextual understanding and stylistic nuances. 
3. Model Fine-Tuning & Optimization – Implemented transfer learning techniques using 
frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, optimizing the model for structured and 
meaningful poetry generation. 
4. Developing a Streamlit Web Interface – Designed an interactive Streamlit-based web 
application where users could input themes, styles, and moods to generate personalized 
poems. 
5. Evaluation & Refinement – Measured model performance based on coherence, 
creativity, and grammatical correctness, adjusting hyperparameters to enhance poetic 
output. 
6. Final Deployment & Documentation – Integrated the model into the user-friendly web 
interface, documented the project workflow, challenges encountered, and future 
enhancements for further improvements.
